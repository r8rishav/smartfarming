## 🔎 Overview



AgroSense is a comprehensive project that reviews and demonstrates how modern technologies can revolutionize farming. [cite_start]It explores the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time data collection and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for interactive user engagement.The goal is to create a practical, low-cost smart farming system that empowers users with live data for better farm management, addressing the food demands of a growing global population by improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability.



The web platform serves as an interactive front-end to present this research, making the concepts accessible and understandable through practical demonstrations like a real-time data dashboard and an intelligent chatbot.

## ✨ Key Features



* **Responsive Web Interface:** A single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is fully responsive on all devices.

* **Live IoT Dashboard:** Features a link to a live dashboard designed to display real-time sensor data from a connected hardware prototype.The dashboard monitors crucial environmental data, including humidity, water levels, rainfall detection, and day/night cycles.

* **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Integrated with the **Google Gemini API**, the chatbot provides interactive information and answers user queries specifically about the research project and its findings.

* **Automatic Irrigation Control:** The system includes logic to automatically control a water pump based on real-time soil moisture readings.

* **Light/Dark Theme:** A modern UI with a theme toggle for a better user experience.

* **Globally Deployed:** The showcase website is deployed using **Firebase Hosting** for high availability and performance.
